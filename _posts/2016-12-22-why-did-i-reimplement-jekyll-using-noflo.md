  Jekyll is a delightful piece of software. A Ruby application that turns your
  Markdown and HTML files to a nicely constructed static website. Since the
  generated site is static, you can deploy and serve it from anywhere with no
  security or performance concerns. As a matter of fact, this site is built with
  Jekyll.
