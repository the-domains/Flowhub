  I've been attending the Bosch Connected Experience IoT hackathon this week at
  Station Berlin. Bosch brought a lot of different devices to the event, all
  connected to send telemetry to Eclipse Hono. To make them more discoverable,
  and enable rapid prototyping I decided to expose them all to Flowhub via the
  MsgFlo distributed FBP runtime.
