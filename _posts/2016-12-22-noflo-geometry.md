  Now that we have a working noflo-canvas it is time to try more complex shapes.
  Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay Triangulation are canonical algorithms from
  Computational Geometry and were made classic for generative art or creative
  coding. These algorithms are useful to create textures or meshes.
