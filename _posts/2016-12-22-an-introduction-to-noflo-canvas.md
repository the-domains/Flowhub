  Following Forrest's suggestions we have designed noflo-canvas inspired by
  Grasshopper, an algorithmic modeling tool for Rhino. In Grasshopper you can
  create an unique point or an array of points using the same component. In
  noflo-canvas, you have components like MakePoint which receives an unique pair
  of (x,y) coordinates or an array of them.
