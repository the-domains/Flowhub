  Today I'm happy to announce the public beta of the Flowhub interface for
  Flow-Based Programming. This is the latest step in the adventure that started
  with some UI sketching early last year, went through our successful
  Kickstarter — and now — thanks to our 1 205 backers, it is available to the
  public.
