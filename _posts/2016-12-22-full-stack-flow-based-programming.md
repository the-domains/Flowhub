  The idea of Full-Stack Development is quite popular at the moment — building
  things that run both the browser and the server side of web development,
  usually utilizing similar languages and frameworks.


  With Flow-Based Programming and the emerging Flowhub ecosystem, we can take
  this even further. Thanks to the FBP network protocol we can build and monitor
  graphs spanning multiple devices and flow-based environments.
