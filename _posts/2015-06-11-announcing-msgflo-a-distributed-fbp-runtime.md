      NGINX leads the pack in web performance, and it's all due to the way the
      software is designed. Whereas many web servers and application servers use
      a simple threaded or process-based architecture, NGINX stands out with a
      sophisticated event-driven architecture that enables it to scale to
      hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections on modern hardware.
