  SuperCollider is an open source project for real-time audio synthesis and
  algorithmic composition. It is split into two parts; an interpreter (sclang)
  implementing the SuperCollider language and the audio synthesis server
  (scsynth). The server has an directed acyclic graph of nodes which it executes
  to produce the audio output ( paper| book on internals).
